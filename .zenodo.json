  "description": "This work introduces the Cognitive Phase Law (CPL), a formal principle describing the dynamics of cognitive state transitions in observers. Building on the Minimal Model of Subjective Physics, CPL characterizes discrete cognitive phases and the conditions under which transitions occur. The law predicts hysteresis effects and critical slowing during cognitive transitions, empirically testable via neurodynamics (EEG, fMRI) and behavioral paradigms.",
